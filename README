Project Write-Up

1. Overview of Algorithm
- blah


2. Applying our algorithm to an interesting board
- come up with examples, show how naive approach (just bfs)
  may differ/fail compared to ours (bfs + backtracking)


3. Evaluation of our algorithm with respect to finding and minimizing wire layouts
- discuss how we ended up with the wires that we placed and also talk about their length


4. Evaluation of the time complexity and wall-clock time of our algorithm
- p! * (p * n) = all the combinations of wires * bfs for each of the pairs
  - n = number of spots on the board
  - p = number of pairs (could be n/2 at most)
- wall clock time = time shown after running a test
